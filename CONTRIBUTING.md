## Contribution Workflow

The following flow is expected for all code submissons:
- Create a branch with a name following the guidelines: `gh(x)_(synopsis)`
  - where x is the ticket number
  - where synopsis is a short synopsis for the reason for the branch.
- Create a pull request [https://github.com/rdkcentral/python_raft/compare](https://github.com/rdkcentral/python_raft/compare) when the code changes are ready for review.
- The team will review, and if accepted your changes will be merged to the mainline.

**All changes must be submitted for review with a corresponding issue, [python_raft/issues](https://github.com/rdkcentral/python_raft/issues).**

*If an issue does not exist for the change you wish to contribute, please create one with a detailed description of the reason for your change.*
