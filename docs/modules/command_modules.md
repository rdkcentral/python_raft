# Command Modules

**Directory:** `framework/core/commandModules`

**Purpose:**

The command modules facilitate seamless interaction with various console-based systems, including SSH, serial, and Telnet.
They offer a comprehensive set of essential methods, such as `write`, `read_all`, `read_until`, `open`, and `close`, which are 
universally applicable across different types of consoles. These methods streamline the execution of commands, retrieval of data 
and management of sessions within tests.
